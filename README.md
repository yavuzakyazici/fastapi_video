# ðŸŽ¥ FastAPI Video Streaming Example

A minimal FastAPI project that demonstrates **video streaming** capabilities using Python.  
Shows how to serve large media files efficiently â€” great for building media apps, e-learning platforms, or secure video APIs.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** â€“ Modern web framework
- **Starlette** â€“ ASGI middleware and response utilities
- **Uvicorn** â€“ ASGI server
- **Range Requests** â€“ Partial content serving (seek support)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Features

- Serve video files with **byte-range support**
- Use `StreamingResponse` for large file efficiency
- Works with MP4 and other media formats
- Designed for future expansion (e.g. auth, analytics)

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yavuzakyazici/fastapi_video.git
cd fastapi_video
```

2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add sample video
Put an .mp4 file into the /videos folder (e.g., demo.mp4)

5. Run the app
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Go to: http://localhost:8000/video/demo.mp4

ðŸ§ª Endpoints
GET /video/{filename}
Streams a video file with byte-range support (seekable in browser).

Example:

```bash
curl -i -H "Range: bytes=0-" http://localhost:8000/video/demo.mp4
```

ðŸ“Ž Notes
- Range header is used to enable partial downloads (streaming)
- StreamingResponse sends chunks of the file on the fly
- Easily extensible for:
- User-based video access control
- Watermarking
- Streaming logs / analytics
